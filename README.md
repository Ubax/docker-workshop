# Docker workshop

This repository is designed for a Docker workshop, which is divided into two parts:

1. Docker Kata - a series of exercises to learn the basics of Docker
2. Implementation - a part where you will dockerize a simple web application

## 1. Kata

In this section, youâ€™ll learn the basics of Docker by completing a series of exercises. The exercises and required resources are located in the [`Kata`](./Kata/README.md) directory. This is the fork of [docker-katas](https://github.com/eficode-academy/docker-katas) maintained by Eficode.

## 2. Implementation

In this part of the workshop, you will create Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for a simple web application. The application consisting of 3 services is in [`Implementation`](./Implementation/Readme.md) directory.

## Advanced topics

If you find the Kata exercises easy or want to dive deeper into Docker, check out the [`Advanced`](./Advanced/) directory. It covers more in-depth topics like the Docker API, Docker layers, and Docker Bake. Note that this section is still a work in progress.

## Suggestions for improvement

If you have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
